# Sentiment Analysis ðŸ™‚ðŸ™ƒ

**Sentiment Analysis for YouTube, Reddit, and Reviews** is a machine learning-based project that analyzes and classifies the sentiment of comments from **YouTube videos**, **Reddit posts**, and **Product/Service reviews**. The sentiments are categorized as **Positive**, **Negative**, and **Neutral**. This project allows users to input a YouTube video URL to analyze its comments, specify a subreddit to analyze posts and comments, and even paste product or service reviews for sentiment classification.

## Introduction

The **Sentiment Analysis for YouTube, Reddit, and Reviews** project leverages machine learning algorithms to classify the sentiment of comments from YouTube videos, posts from Reddit, and general product/service reviews. The sentiment is classified into **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral** categories. 

The project is designed to provide users with a simple way to analyze opinions and sentiments from online platforms:

- **YouTube**: Analyze comments from any YouTube video by pasting the URL.
- **Reddit**: Analyze posts and comments from a specified subreddit.
- **Review Analysis**: Paste product or service reviews and obtain sentiment classification for each review.

The sentiment analysis uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques, leveraging models such as **VADER** and **scikit-learn** to efficiently classify text data.

## How It Works

1. **YouTube**:
   - Fetches comments from the YouTube video URL provided by the user using the **Google API Client**.
   - Preprocesses the text and applies **VADER** and **scikit-learn** models for sentiment classification.
   - Classifies each comment as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**.

2. **Reddit**:
   - Fetches posts and comments from the specified subreddit using **PRAW**.
   - Preprocesses the text and performs sentiment analysis on the posts and comments.
   - Classifies the sentiment of each post's comments as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**.

3. **Review Analysis**:
   - Takes a list of product or service reviews as input.
   - Preprocesses the review text and applies **VADER** and **scikit-learn** models for sentiment classification.
   - Classifies each review as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Displays sentiment analysis results using **Matplotlib** to plot graphs that show the distribution of sentiment across the comments, posts, or reviews.
